#Python the hard way: Ejercicio 3

# A comment, this is, so you can read your program later.
# BTW I'm just gonna copy everything that in the excercises

print("I could have code like this.") # And the comment gets ignored
print("The code gets ignored when # appears or something.")

# Bruh, this is lame... This dude, teaching me how to comment code
